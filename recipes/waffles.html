    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two 
        plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface 
        impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe 
        used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, 
        which has over a dozen regional varieties. Waffles may 
        be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially cooked and frozen.</p>
